# Sakila_project_exercises


Hello folks, 

I made this little git-hub repository to showcase my skills in writing SQL codes. 

The database that I used is Sakila Sample Database from MySQL website: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-structure.html
It is consisted of 16 seperated tables that are connected by primary and foreign keys. Each table stores data on a part of the operational 
process of a DVD rental company. For instance, on the 'film' table, it has columns like title,  release_year, language_id, etc. Other tables 
has similar but different information. 

My job is to use this database and various SQL codes to create tables, views, triggers, stored procedures; retrieve specific pieces of data; 
update existing data tables with new info; and delete any data from existing tables. In the meantime, I will try to write my codes as efficiently
as possible.

I hope you will enjoy what I have to offer here.

Please feel free to make commits on How I can optimize my logic or codes! 

Peace and love.

David
